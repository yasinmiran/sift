Newest first. Entries carry date, what, why (the signal), outcome.
Backlog holds ideas too big for one day; lessons distill Yasin's
merges and closures and never expire.

## Backlog

- web-dev's feed has been frozen since 2026-06 while the site still
  builds (sitemap lastmod runs current). Recheck around 2026-09-29;
  developer.chrome.com/static/blog/feed.xml is the candidate
  substitute if it stays dead.
- project-zero's feed is 13MB per fetch, twice daily, for a source
  that posts every few months. A cheaper probe strategy is worth a
  look if ingest bandwidth ever matters.
- substack-backed sources (big-technology, normal-technology) send no
  usable validator, so they re-parse every run. Harmless, noted.

Quiet run, no PR: #109 is still open and unreviewed, and the contract
allows one open gardener PR at a time. Spent the run on signals
instead.

Health sweep found one real thing. `ingest.yml`'s cron (`15 3` /
`45 15` UTC) stopped landing before the digest windows on 2026-08-27:
scheduled runs went from a steady +13m..+53m across the prior 24 runs
to +3h08..+12h02, and today's 03:15 never fired at all (still absent
at 08:06). Consequence is visible from both sides: seven consecutive
digest runs since 08-27 each forced their own `workflow_dispatch`
ingest minutes before drafting, and the digest commit messages say so
in their own words ("items file was empty (404) at run start, well
past the 03:15 UTC ingest cron"). Today's items file carries
`generatedAt 04:37`, the manual dispatch, not the cron. The morning
margin was only ever ~30 minutes (03:15 cron, 04:34 digest, 36-47m
typical delay), so it was the first to go.

Filed as issue #112 rather than shipped: the two options that
actually cover a cron that never fires both edit ../AGENTS.md, the
digest agent's contract, which is not mine to change. The one option
I could ship alone (move the crons earlier) only widens a window and
would have looked like progress without being any.

Rest of the sweep was clean and stays unfiled: `npm test` 158/158,
typecheck clean, `npm run site` builds 33 pages at 1.2MB, `npm run
verify` returns ok with zero warnings on 08-27..08-30 (the older
warnings are all "link not found in the day's items", the known
HN-permalink and secondary-source pattern, not regressions).

Outcome: no PR by design. #109 pending, #110 pending, #112 filed.

### 2026-08-29

First run. What: swapped the footer disclaimer's text color from
`--faint` to `--muted` (src/site/page.ts, `.foot-note`), matching the
color its own inline link already uses. Why: `npm run site` +
playwright screenshot at 375px showed the note rendering visibly dim;
computed contrast against the pinned palette's own hex values was
~2.7:1 (`--faint` on `--bg`), under WCAG AA's 4.5:1 for normal text.
`--muted` brings it to ~4.1:1, no palette hex touched or added
(test/contract.test.ts unaffected).

Copilot's automatic review on #109 caught a real regression: with the
note and its link both `--muted`, the link (global `a` has
`text-decoration:none`) lost its only non-color signal. Fixed with a
second push: `.foot-note a` gets back a dotted underline, same
pattern `.notify-hint` already uses. Copilot also noted `--muted` is
itself still under AA at 4.1:1; true, but so is every other
`--muted`-tier chrome element sitewide (`.byline`, `.meta`, `.tag`),
so that's a bigger, sitewide repaint call, not this PR's, filed as
issue #110 for Yasin to greenlight. Outcome: pending, PR #109.

Contract written; no run yet. Backlog seeded from the 2026-08-29
refresh audit (source health probe, digest drift review).
