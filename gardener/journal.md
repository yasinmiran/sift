Newest first. Entries carry date, what, why (the signal), outcome.
Backlog holds ideas too big for one day; lessons distill Yasin's
merges and closures and never expire.

## Backlog

- web-dev's feed has been frozen since 2026-06 while the site still
  builds (sitemap lastmod runs current). Recheck around 2026-09-29;
  developer.chrome.com/static/blog/feed.xml is the candidate
  substitute if it stays dead.
- project-zero's feed is 13MB per fetch, twice daily, for a source
  that posts every few months. A cheaper probe strategy is worth a
  look if ingest bandwidth ever matters.
- substack-backed sources (big-technology, normal-technology) send no
  usable validator, so they re-parse every run. Harmless, noted.

### 2026-08-29

First run. What: swapped the footer disclaimer's text color from
`--faint` to `--muted` (src/site/page.ts, `.foot-note`), matching the
color its own inline link already uses. Why: `npm run site` +
playwright screenshot at 375px showed the note rendering visibly dim;
computed contrast against the pinned palette's own hex values was
~2.7:1 (`--faint` on `--bg`), under WCAG AA's 4.5:1 for normal text.
`--muted` brings it to ~4.1:1, no palette hex touched or added
(test/contract.test.ts unaffected). Outcome: pending, PR #109.

Contract written; no run yet. Backlog seeded from the 2026-08-29
refresh audit (source health probe, digest drift review).
